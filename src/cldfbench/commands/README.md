# `cldfbench` commands

Code to be run as subcommand in the `cldfbench` cli must comply with the following spec:

1. It must be provided in a python module, the name of which will serve as the command name.
2. The module must provide a function `run`, accepting the `argparse.Namespace` as only positional
   argument. This function should implement the command's functionality.
3. The module may provide a function `register`, accepting a `argparse.Parser` instance, to add
   custom cli parser functionality.
4. The module must be part of an installed Python package, which is published via an entry point, e.g.
   by adding the following arguments to the `setuptools.setup` call in `setup.py`:
   ```python
   packages=setuptools.find_packages(where='.'),
   entry_points={
        'cldfbench.commands': [
            'commands=path.to.package',
        ],
   },
   ```

A command's `register` function can use packaged functionality from `cldfbench.cli_util`, e.g.
to add options for standard reference catalogs (see `cldfbench.catalogs`), or for dataset discovery.
See [the API documentation](https://cldfbench.readthedocs.io/en/latest/commands.html) for details.


## Dataset specific commands

Individual datasets can be installed as Python packages as well, thanks to their `setup.py` file.
This means that you can provide custom `cldfbench` subcommands with a dataset, e.g.
commands to analyze the CLDF data created from a dataset.

To do so,
- add a Python package with a unique name (e.g. `<datasetid>commands` to your dataset, i.e. create a 
  subdirectory `<datasetid>commands`, containing
  - an empty file `__init__.py`,
  - python modules as specified above implementing the commands,
- make this package known to `cldfbench` via an entry point in `setup.py`:
  ```python
  entry_points={
      'cldfbench.commands': [
          'dsid=<datasetid>commands',
      ],
  }
  ```
- install the dataset running `pip install -e .`
- check the availability of your custom commands running `cldfbench -h`.

Note: Since the package containing the commands is imported as top-level Python, it is important to give it a name that does not clash with any other Python package you may want to use! Python packages and modules are singletons identified by name, so only one will be imported!
